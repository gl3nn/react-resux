# Development

## Linting

We use eslint with [@typescript-eslint/parser](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint) as our linter
tool. To run:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix
```

## Testing

We use [jest](https://jestjs.io/) as our test framework. To execute the entire test suite run:

```bash
npm run test
npm run test:watch
npm run test:coverage
```

## Documentation

We use [docz](https://www.docz.site/) as our documentation framework. To see the documentation in dev mode run:

```bash
npm run docs:watch
```

## Deploying & Publishing

To publish a new package on [NPM](http://npmjs.com) run:

```bash
npm run release
```

To publish the documentation run:

```bash
npm run release:docs
```

It might take some time for github pages to update its caches once docs are deployed, so be patient.

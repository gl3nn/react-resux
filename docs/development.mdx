# Development

## Testing

We use JEST as our test framework. To execute the entire test suite run:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Documentation

To see the documentation in dev mode run:

```bash
npm run docs:watch
```

## Deploying & Publishing

To publish a new package on [NPM](http://npmjs.com) run:

```bash
npm run release
```

To publish the documentation run:

```bash
npm run release:docs
```

It might take some time for [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to update its caches once docs are deployed, so be
patient.

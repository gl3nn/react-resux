# Introduction

Opinionated, Redux abstraction with built-in immutability, async and more. Heavily dva inspired.

## Benefits

* Easy to use and learn. Only a few public interfaces (i.e. combineModelReducers, subscribersRootSaga, Model, Subscriber, connectResux or equivalent hooks).
* Boilerplate reduction (i.e. actions, dispatchers, reducers).
* Immutability with normal JavaScript objects and arrays. No new APIs to learn!
* Async, typescript, memoised selectors, and hooks support.
* Tiny footprint (i.e. ~6KB).

## Installation

Using npm:

```bash
npm install react-resux --save
```

Using yarn:

```bash
yarn add react-resux
```

# Introduction

Opinionated, Redux abstraction with built-in immutability, normalization, and selectors support.

## Benefits

* Easy to use and learn. Only two essential public interfaces (i.e. combineModelReducers, Model).
* Boilerplate reduction (i.e. action, dispatcher, reducers, map*to*). Less noise, more concise code.
* Immutability with normal JavaScript objects and arrays. No new APIs to learn!
* Built-in and transparent data normalization. No need to do it yourself.
* Memoized data selectors.
* React Hooks support.

## Installation

* **NPM**: npm install kaytum --save
* **Yarn**: yarn add kaytum

## Philosophy & Overview

Unlike barebone React/Redux, this project is very opinionated about how data should be structured and updated.
This makes it possible to solve many common problems out of the box, such as data immutability, normalization
and excessive boilerplate.

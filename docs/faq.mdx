# FAQ

## Is using vanilla redux/redux-sagas and react-resux together fine?
Yep, perfectly fine. No problem.

## How does this compare to dva?
[Dva](https://github.com/dvajs/dva) doesn't have selectors support. Also, dva includes react-router integration, which we think is out of scope for
a state management abstraction. Its documentation and community is mostly chinese, so be prepared.

## Are there similar alternatives to this library?
Besides dva, the closest thing would be [mobx-state-tree](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-state-tree), but that's not for redux.

## I like redux-thunks, redux-observable, redux-pack, or other async middleware. Is it possible to use anything other than redux-saga for effects in models/subscribers?
No. That said we guarantee redux-saga won't disappoint you. If you strongly want to stick to any of those other
async middlewares, but don't want to give up on resux, consider using resux without effects/subscribers.

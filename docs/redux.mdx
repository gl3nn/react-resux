# Integrating with Redux

Before you can use a model in your components, you have to hook its model reducers into redux. For such do:

```javascript
import {modelA, modelB} from './models';
import {createStore, combineReducers} from 'redux';

const reducers = combineReducers({
  kaytum: combineModelReducers([modelA, modelB]),
});

const store = createStore(todoApp);
```

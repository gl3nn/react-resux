# Integrating with Redux/Redux Saga

Before you can use a model in your components, you have to hook its model's reducers into redux. The same applies for
hooking the subscribers and model's effects into redux-saga. For such do:

```javascript
import {
  combineModelReducers,
  resuxRootSaga,
} from 'react-resux';
import createSagaMiddleware from 'redux-saga';
import {
  applyMiddleware,
  combineReducers,
  createStore,
} from 'redux';

import {modelA, modelB} from './models';
import {subscriberX} from './subscribers';

const sagaMiddleware = createSagaMiddleware();

const store = createStore(combineReducers({
  ...combineModelReducers([modelA, modelB]),
}), applyMiddleware(sagaMiddleware));

sagaMiddleware.run(() => resuxRootSaga([modelA, modelB, subscriberX]));
```
